This repository contains Team Yasodharapura's code for the Data Pipeline Knowledge Transfer Project (36-614 &amp; 36-611).
At this stage, we have created two Python code scripts for loading the necessary data into our designed tables. (We are working with the College Scorecards data.) The first Python script, named "load-ipeds.py", contains code for loading data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS); the second script, named "load-scorecard.py", contains code for loading data from the College Scorecard data files.
Before running either of these two Python scripts, make sure to change the username and password in the "credentials_proj.py" file, as both scripts use these information to access the database where the designed tables would be stored. Without changing the username and/or password, the scripts would not be able to load the data to the correct database, so make sure that this is done before running them.
Afterwards, to run either script, open the command line shell and change the working directory to the one with the CSV file(s) containing the relevant data. Then, type "python" in the command line, followed by the name of the Python script to run, then followed by the name of the data file to be loaded. (Each item in the command line should be separated by a space.) Once this is done, the data from the CSV file should be successfully loaded into various tables, which would be stored in the database specified by the aforementioned credentials.
A few things to note regarding the usage of the two scripts. Firstly, in order to run "load-scorecard.py", the "load-ipeds.py" script must be run first, because one of the resulting tables from running "load-scorecard.py" contains non-static information that is dependent on the static table generated from "load-ipeds.py". Secondly, only the IPEDS and College Scorecard data from the same years can be compared (i.e. College Scorecard data from the 2021~2022 school year must be compared to IPEDS data from 2022), as the indexing for different variables in the resulting tables would changes based on the year. Finally, note that schools in the College Scorecard data are only labeled by the agencies by which they were accredited starting in the 2021~2022 school year, meaning that the "accredited agency" variable would consist of null values in the preceding years.
